Introduction
------------

Using [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Raphaël](http://raphaeljs.com/) to mimic the use and action of a canal lock. It's online [here](https://googledrive.com/host/0ByRgQIhodQXfaVdHOElsZTV5c3c/canal/).

I did the original in order to help teach the kids about how a lock works - they'd been through enough of them and cycled over one at least once a day on the way to primary school - that I thought that a visual representation might be in order.

History
-------

Originally made using proprietary JavaScript from Adobe in the dim and distant past I used my new-found love of Raphaël to make it work without having to have an ancient version of Adobe's SVG plugin for IE6. Or IE6 for that matter!

The original is included in the repo as lock.svg and is still online [here](https://googledrive.com/host/0ByRgQIhodQXfaVdHOElsZTV5c3c/canal/lock/) - by all means if you can get it to work then you're welcome to it.

Future
------

Not only does it now work in IE6 but in all modern browsers.

The new version is coloured thanks to [Sarah](http://www.landofpaintedsky.com/) from [work](http://arcusglobal.com), thanks Sarah!

I'm sure the code could be a little more elegant but it was hard enough figuring out how to reference the Raphaël elements from jQuery. Please feel free to improve it and please do let me know what you do, perhaps send me a link. It might be fun to use it to create a [flight of locks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingley_Five_Rise_Locks).
