Using [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Raphaël](http://raphaeljs.com/) to mimic the use and action of a canal lock. It's online here

Originally made using proprietary JavaScript from Adobe in the dim and distant past I used my new-found love of Raphaël to make it work without having to have an ancient version of Adobe's SVG plugin for IE6.

Not only does it now work in IE6 but in all modern browsers.

The original is included in the repo as lock.svg and is still online [here](https://googledrive.com/host/0ByRgQIhodQXfaVdHOElsZTV5c3c/canal/lock/) - by all means if you can get it to work then you're welcome to it.

The new version is coloured thanks to [Sarah](http://www.landofpaintedsky.com/)<a href="">Sarah</a> from [work](http://arcusglobal.com), thanks Sarah!
